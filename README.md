Network Image Plus is a Flutter package that allows you to rendered images on the web using CanvasKit without CORS issues.

## Features

This plugin uses `HtmlElementView` to create an `img` element and set the src to the url provided.
If the plugin is running on a io platform, it will use the regular `Image.network` widget.

## Getting started

Add `network_image_plus` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
```yaml
network_image_plus: ^1.0.3
```
or install it using the command
```shell
flutter pub add network_image_plus
```

## Usage

Import the package in your dart file

```dart
import 'package:network_image_plus/network_image_plus.dart';

const image = NetworkImagePlus(
  url: 'https://example.com/image.png',
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
);
```
